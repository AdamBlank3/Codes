          <p>
            The purpose of web application penetration testing is to proactively
            identify and address security vulnerabilities before malicious
            actors can exploit them. By conducting these tests, organizations
            can enhance the security of their web applications, protect
            sensitive information, and ensure the availability and reliability
            of their services. The project's ultimate goal is to provide
            actionable recommendations to improve the security posture of the
            tested web applications.

          <p>
            A Patient Health Monitoring System is a technology-driven project
            that tracks and records vital health parameters such as heart rate,
            blood pressure, temperature, and more in real-time. It provides
            healthcare professionals and patients with instant data access for
            timely interventions, improving patient care and overall health
            outcomes.

            It is a sophisticated project designed to enhance the security
            posture of a network by using machine learning techniques to detect
            and mitigate potential security threats and intrusions. In this
            project, we have used Logistic regression, SVM, k-means, and
            Hierarchical Algorithms to find accuracy and also whether to use
            supervised or unsupervised learning
